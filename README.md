# void_switch_kicad
Kicad files for making an analog hall effect keyboard PCB using 3D printed [Void Switches](https://github.com/riskable/void_switch).

**NOTE:** These files were made for use with Kicad 6.

## How to use these files
Open up Kicad and add the `footprints` directory to your project's footprint libraries...

![Manage Footprint Libraries](/assets/images/prefs_footprints.png)

Click the folder icon to add a new path

![Click the folder icon](/assets/images/add_footprint_path1.png)

Navigate to your clone of this repo's `footprints` directory and click "Open"

![Open the path](/assets/images/add_footprint_path2.png)

Change the name to "VoidSwitch" so it'll be easier to use/find

![Change the name to VoidSwitch](/assets/images/add_footprint_path3.png)

Now do the same thing for the Void Switch and "49e" (linear hall effect sensor) symbol libraries

![Add the symbol libraries](/assets/images/add_symbols1.png)

Now you should be able to use all the Void Switch footprints/symbols and hall effect sensor symbol in your own Kicad project.

## Will be posting tutorial videos soon!
